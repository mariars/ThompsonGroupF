Thompson Group F 
=============
The goal is to compute the squared 2-norms of h_n  defined in the article 
"A COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH TO THE THOMPSONGROUP F" 
by  S. HAAGERUP, U. HAAGERUP, M. RAMIREZ-SOLANO.

This series of numbers are key ingredient for all the computations done in the mentioned article.
The instructions for the binaries (for Windows 7)  are in /Csharp/FL2NormOnFilesHalfSize/INSTRUCTIONS.txt

We input this generated series of numbers (case h=A+B+A^-1+B^-1) into the mathematica file /Mathematica/ABAinvBinv.nb
(We include a pdf version of the mathematica file.)
